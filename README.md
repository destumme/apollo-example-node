# Apollo Federation Example (Typescript & Node)
Very much a WIP, this is not polished yet and should be treated more as notes than anything.

Eventually this will be used a a reference implementation for myself to follow for reimplementing the 3 subgraphs in both dotnet and rust.

An example implementation of a self hosted federated graphql graph using Apollo Router.

The schemas included are a contrived set of simplistic data types for handling a pay per click campaign of url advertisements.

```
corepack enable
yarn install
```
